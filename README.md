# California-House-Prediction-
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to analyse how demographic, economic, and geographic features influence housing prices and to train a regression model that makes accurate predictions.

Source: California Housing Dataset (scikit-learn)
Target variable: Median House Value
Features include:
Median income
House age
Average rooms & bedrooms
Population & occupancy
Geographic coordinates (Latitude & Longitude)


Models Used
1. Linear Regression 
Used as a baseline model for comparison

2. Random Forest Regressor 
Ensemble-based, non-linear model
Captures complex interactions between features
Performed significantly better than Linear Regression
